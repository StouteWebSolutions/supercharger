# supercharger
A simple WordPress Plugin that adds some basic security and performance enhancements. 

## What is this?
The supercharger plugin is a must use plugin for WordPress that deactivates many of the abused access points and services that are enabled by default in WordPress. This plugin also adds two settings pages for "Performance" and "Security" settings inside of the default "Settings" sidebar menu option that allows WordPress users to enable/disable these enhancements quickly without needing to access a hosting control panel or SFTP.

## Is this needed?
The supercharger plugin is not required at all and most quality hosting companies take care of these settings on their end, the issue is that when this happens, the admin users are unable to quickly enable/disable these settings without contacting the hosting company's support for testing. This allows admin users easy access to these settings while disabling many of these unnessecary features as soon as the plugin has been activated. 

### Can't I do all of this without installing this plugin? 
Yes, of course you can. None of these features are revolutionary and many of them are well documented across the internet. All we have done is compile them into a single plugin and provided a settings page to enable/disable the features quickly so admin users within WordPress are able to work with these settings while testing their own website.
